What's included?
================

GimmeMotifs is dependent upon the great work of others: motif prediction
algorithms. GimmeMotifs includes several tools by default:

-  BioProspector http://motif.stanford.edu/distributions/bioprospector/

-  GADEM
   http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/gadem/index.cfm

-  Improbizer http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/

-  MDmodule (included in the MotifRegressor Package)
   http://www.math.umass.edu/~conlon/mr.html

-  MEME http://meme.sdsc.edu/

-  MoAn http://moan.binf.ku.dk/

-  MotifSampler
   http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/bioi/thijs/download.html

-  trawler http://ani.embl.de/trawler/

-  HMS http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/qin/HMS/

-  AMD 

-  ChIPMunk http://autosome.ru/smbsm/librettos/libretto_chipmunk/chipmunk_home.rhtml

-  Posmo https://cb.utdallas.edu/Posmo/index.html

Almost all these tools are installed automatically with GimmeMotifs. Due to an
issue with MoAn and the Ubuntu gcc version, I was not able to compile
MoAn for the Ubuntu package, which means MoAn is not included. To use
these programs *no additional steps have to be taken* (except for
MotifSampler see :ref:`MotifSampler`). 

**Please note: all these programs include their own license and most are free
for academic or non-commercial use only! For commercial use of any of these 
programs, please consult the respective author!**
