GimmeMotifs for transcription factor motif analysis
===================================================

What is GimmeMotifs?
--------------------

GimmeMotifs is an analysis framework for transcription factor motif analysis written in Python.
It contains command-line scripts to predict *de novo* motifs, scan for known motifs, identify differential motifs, calculate motif enrichment statistics, plot sequence logos and more.
In addition, all this functionality is available from a Python API.

GimmeMotifs is free and open source research software.
