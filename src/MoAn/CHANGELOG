CHANGELOG FOR MoAn


v1.01
* Fixed arbitrary maximum constraint of 2 WMs
* Changed so that specifiying more WMs does not automatically imply co-occurrence scoring

v1.00
Initial version (used in paper)



FUTURE RELEASES:

* Multiple chains rather than collective optimization of multiple WMs
* Optimize optimization so that is not so slow :-)
